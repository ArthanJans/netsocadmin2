### What We Offer

#### Free server space
You can create a free account on one of our servers. What you do with it is all up to you!

Please do read the `ACCEPTABLE_USAGE_POLICY` file in your home directory. If you are found to be in violation of this, we will stop whatever you are doing and possibly remove your account.

#### Free web hosting
Your `public_html` folder in you home-directory will be the root of your website. This website can be found at `"http://<your username>.netsoc.co"`.

Please contact us if you wish to have your own domain name point to this site instead. You aren't restricted to a single domain name! You can have many different domain names point to various subfolders in your `public_html`!

#### MySQL Databases
With your account comes a MySQL account. This database will not be reset after the college year, unlike other offerings of this service from college departments.

Your MySQL databases can be found at `mysql.netsoc.co`. Your MySQL username will be your server username. To create new databases, remove databases or reset your MySQL password, please see the `MYSQL` tab in your admin tools.

Please note, the name of your database will be prefixed with your username and an underscore. So if your username is `john`, your database names will be of the form `"john_<rest of name here>"`.

#### Home Directory Backups
We keep weekly backups of home-directories, going back 4 weeks. At the end of every month, we backup your home directly. These monthly backups go back forever.

If you need to recover a backup, see the `BACKUPS` tab in your admin tools.
