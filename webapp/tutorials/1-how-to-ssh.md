### How to login over SSH

Once you have gotten your username and password by email after registration, you are ready to login to the server.

The server you will be logging into can be found at `"leela.netsoc.co"`.

#### Unix/Linux
Go to a terminal, and then run: `"ssh john@leela.netsoc.co"`, replacing `"john"` with your username.

You will be prompted for your password. Input it and then hit enter. When typing your password, it might look like its not being input. Don't worry! This is normal behaviour for Unix/Linux. You will then be logged in to the server in your home-directory.

#### Windows
Windows does not natively support SSH over the command line. You must therefore download an SSH client.

Download and install [Putty](http://www.putty.org/).

In the hostname field, enter `"leela.netsoc.co"` and in the port field, enter `"22"`. Make sure the connection type is `SSH` and click `open`.

Then just enter your username and password, and you're in.
